# parsnet
TensorFlow implementation of the constraints necessary for [Parseval networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08847).

Parseval networks constrain the weight matrices of neural networks to be tight frames, so that the Lipschitz constant of the entire network is <= 1. This makes the entire network a contraction, and limits the amount an adversarial perturbation can propagate through the network. For an in-depth introduction to this regularization technique, consult [the original article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08847.pdf)/


## Example use
Using the `parsnet` package is very easy. Simply import `parsnet` and use the [`kernel_constraint`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers/conv2d#arguments) keyword argument on your layers of choice:
``` python
import tensorflow as tf
import parsnet


img_size = (32, 32, 3)
batch_size = 512
retraction_par = 0.001
num_passes = 1

input_layer = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(batch_size, *img_size))

layer1 = tf.layers.conv2d(
    inputs=input_layer,
    kernel_size=(5, 5),
    filters=64,
    strides=(1, 1),
    padding="SAME",
    activation=tf.nn.relu,
    kernel_initializer=tf.initializers.orthogonal(),
    name="convlayer1",

    # Applying Parseval constraint:
    kernel_constraint=parsnet.constraints.tight_frame(beta, num_passes)
)

...

```

Since the Parseval contraint limits the weight matrices to have orthonormal rows, we recommend using the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer to ensure that this criteria is met when the network is initialized.
